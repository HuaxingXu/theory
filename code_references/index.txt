We decided to create the Toolbox and this documentation in order to
fully allow for the principle of *reproducible research* [Donoho2009]_
in the research area of SFS. Like other fields that involve
signal processing, the study of SFS implies implementing a multitude of
algorithms and running numerical simulations on a computer. As a
consequence, the outcome of the algorithms are easily vulnerable to
implementation errors which cannot completely be avoided [Ince2012]_.

State something about the reproduction of the figures ...

The first version of this document is based on the PhD thesis of
[Wierstorf2014]_. It is now evolving under the participations of all the team
members with the final goal to provide the most up-to-date version of the
current knowledge and software in the field of sound field synthesis.
