===============

We decided to create the Toolbox and this documentation in order to fully allow
for the principle of *reproducible research* [Donoho2009]_.  Like other fields
that involve signal processing, the study of sound field synthesis implies
implementing a multitude of algorithms and running numerical simulations on a
computer. As a consequence, the outcome of the algorithms are easily vulnerable
to implementation errors which cannot completely be avoided [Ince2012]_.
On the other hand, the theory of sound field synthesis is not completely settled
yet and the best solutions for some driving functions are still under dispute or
have not been derived yet.

In order to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date review of the current theory
on sound field synthesis, we summarized the theory of sound field synthesis in
the `Mathematical fundamentals <http://sfstoolbox.org/doc/theory/>`_ section.
Whenever a driving function or some other equation is implemented in the code of
of the SFS Toolbox it comes with a comment providing a reference to the
corresponding equation in this theory section. This provides the possibility to
publish a release of the then current status of the theory together with the
software releases, allowing to verify the references even for older versions of
the software.

    Note, that we will only start with version 2.2.0 of the Matlab Toolbox to
    include this reference scheme.
