**Your guide to understand and apply various sound field synthesis methods**

.. rubric:: What is sound field synthesis?

.. rubric:: Mathematical fundamentals of sound field synthesis

.. rubric:: Numerical simulations

You can make numerical simulations of the resulting sound fields and can even
create binaural simulations of the same sound fields. This enables you to listen
to a large loudspeaker arrays, even if you don't have one in your laboratory or
at home.

We provide the code for the numerical simulations for Python and for
Matlab/Octave, whereby the later is the more complete one.

.. rubric:: Motivation

We decided to create the Toolbox and this documentation in order to
fully allow for the principle of *reproducible research* [Donoho2009]_
in the research area of SFS. Like other fields that involve
signal processing, the study of SFS implies implementing a multitude of
algorithms and running numerical simulations on a computer. As a
consequence, the outcome of the algorithms are easily vulnerable to
implementation errors which cannot completely be avoided [Ince2012]_.

State something about the reproduction of the figures ...

The first version of this document is based on the PhD thesis of
[Wierstorf2014]_. It is now evolving under the participations of all the team
members with the final goal to provide the most up-to-date version of the
current knowledge and software in the field of sound field synthesis.
