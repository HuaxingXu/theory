Sound Field Dimensionality
--------------------------

The single-layer potential  is valid for all :math:`V
\subset {\mathbb{R}}^n`. Consequentially, for practical applications a
two-dimensional () as well as a three-dimensional () synthesis is
possible. Two-dimensional is not referring to a synthesis in a plane
only, but describes a setup that is independent of one dimension. For
example, an infinite cylinder is independent of the dimension along its
axis. The same is true for secondary source distributions in synthesis.
They exhibit line source characteristics and are aligned in parallel to
the independent dimension. Typical arrangements of such secondary
sources are a circular or a linear setup.

The characteristics of the secondary sources limit the set of possible
sources which can be synthesized. For example, when using a secondary
source setup it is not possible to synthesize the amplitude decay of a
point source.

For a synthesis the involved secondary sources depend on all dimensions
and exhibit point source characteristics. In this scenario classical
secondary sources setups would be a sphere or a plane.

Synthesis
~~~~~~~~~

In practice, the most common setups of secondary sources are setups,
employing cabinet loudspeakers. A cabinet loudspeaker does not show the
characteristics of a line source, but of a point source. This
dimensionality mismatch prevents perfect synthesis within the desired
plane. The combination of a secondary source setup with secondary
sources that exhibit characteristics has led to naming such
configurations *synthesis* [Start1997]_. Such scenarios are associated
with a wrong amplitude decay due to the inherent mismatch of secondary
sources as is highlighted in Figure. In general, the amplitude is only
correct at a given reference point :math:`{{\mathbf{x}}}_\text{ref}`.

For a circular secondary source distribution with point source
characteristic the driving function can be derived by introducing
expansion coefficients for the spherical case into the driving
function . The equation is than solved for :math:`\theta = 0{^\circ}`
and :math:`r_\text{ref} = 0`. This results in a driving function given
in [Ahrens2012]_ (3.49) as

.. math::

   D_{\text{circular},\twohalfD}(\phi_0,\omega) = \frac{1}{2{\pi}R_0} \sum_{m=-\infty}^\infty
       \frac{\breve{S}_{|m|}^m (\frac{{\pi}}{2},\phi_\text{s},r_\text{s},\omega)}{\breve{G}_{|m|}^m
       (\frac{{\pi}}{2},0,\omega)}
       \Phi_m(\phi_0) {\;.}\label{eq:D_circular_25D}

For a linear secondary source distribution with point source
characteristics the driving function is derived by introducing the
linear expansion coefficients for a monopole source  into the driving
function  and solving the equation for :math:`y = y_\text{ref}` and
:math:`z = 0`. This results in a driving function given as [Ahrens2012]_
(3.77)

.. math::

   D_{\text{linear},\twohalfD}(x_0,\omega) = \frac{1}{2{\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty
       \frac{\breve{S}(k_x,y_\text{ref},0,\omega)}
       {\breve{G}(k_x,y_\text{ref},0,\omega)} \chi(k_x,x_0) \, {\mathop{\mathrm{d}{k_x}}} {\;.}\label{eq:D_linear_25D}

A driving function for the situation in the context of WFS and
arbitrary geometries of the secondary source distribution can be
achieved by applying the far-field approximation [Williams1999]_ (4.23).
:math:`{\,H_{0}^{(2)}\!}(\zeta) \approx \sqrt{\frac{2{\mathrm{i}}}{{\pi}\zeta}}
{\mathrm{e}}^{-{\mathrm{i}}\zeta}` for :math:`\zeta \gg 1` to the
Green’s function. Using this the following relationship between the and
Green’s functions can be established.

.. math::

   \begin{gathered}
       \underbrace{
       -\frac{{\mathrm{i}}}{4} \;{\,H_{0}^{(2)}\!}\left({\frac{\omega}{c}}|{{\mathbf{x}}}-{{\mathbf{x}}}_0|\right)
       }_{G_\twoD({{\mathbf{x}}}-{{\mathbf{x}}}_0,\omega)}
       \approx
       \sqrt{2{\pi}\frac{c}{{\mathrm{i}}\omega} |{{\mathbf{x}}}-{{\mathbf{x}}}_0|} \;
       \underbrace{
           \frac{1}{4 {\pi}} \frac{{\mathrm{e}}^{-{\mathrm{i}}{\frac{\omega}{c}}|{{\mathbf{x}}}-{{\mathbf{x}}}_0|}}{|{{\mathbf{x}}}-{{\mathbf{x}}}_0|}
       }_{G_\threeD({{\mathbf{x}}}-{{\mathbf{x}}}_0,\omega)} {\;,}\label{eq:25D_approximation}\end{gathered}

where :math:`{\,H_{0}^{(2)}\!}` denotes the Hankel function of second
kind and zeroth order. Inserting this approximation into the
single-layer potential for the case results in

.. math::

   P({{\mathbf{x}}},\omega) = \oint_S \sqrt{2{\pi}\frac{c}{{\mathrm{i}}\omega} |{{\mathbf{x}}}-{{\mathbf{x}}}_0|} \;
       D({{\mathbf{x}}}_0,\omega) G_\threeD({{\mathbf{x}}}-{{\mathbf{x}}}0,\omega) \, {\mathop{\mathrm{d}{A}}}({{\mathbf{x}}}_0) {\;.}\label{eq:single:layer_25D}

If the amplitude correction is further restricted to one reference
point :math:`{{\mathbf{x}}}_\text{ref}`, the driving function for WFS
can be formulated as

.. math::

   D_\twohalfD({{\mathbf{x}}}_0,\omega) = \underbrace{\sqrt{2{\pi}|{{\mathbf{x}}}_\text{ref}-{{\mathbf{x}}}_0|}}_{g_0}
       \sqrt{\frac{c}{{\mathrm{i}}\omega}} \,
       D({{\mathbf{x}}}_0,\omega) {\;,}\label{eq:D25D_wfs}

where :math:`g_0` is independent of :math:`{{\mathbf{x}}}`.
