High Frequency Approximation: WFS
---------------------------------

The single-layer potential  satisfies the homogeneous Helmholtz equation
both in the interior and exterior regions :math:`V` and :math:`V^*
{\mathrel{\!\mathop:}=}{\mathbb{R}}^n \setminus (V \cup \partial V)`. If
:math:`D({{\mathbf{x}}}_0,\omega)` is continuous, the pressure
:math:`P({{\mathbf{x}}},\omega)` is continuous when approaching the
surface :math:`\partial V` from the inside and outside. Due to the
presence of the secondary sources at the surface :math:`\partial V`, the
gradient of :math:`P({{\mathbf{x}}},\omega)` is discontinuous when
approaching the surface. The strength of the secondary sources is then
given by the differences of the gradients approaching :math:`\partial V`
from both sides as [FaziNelson2013]_

.. math:: D({{\mathbf{x}}}_0,\omega) = \partial_{{\mathbf{n}}}P({{\mathbf{x}}}_0,\omega) + \partial_{-{{\mathbf{n}}}} P({{\mathbf{x}}}_0,\omega){\;,}\label{eq:D_gradient}

where
:math:`\partial_{{\mathbf{n}}}\!{\mathrel{\!\mathop:}=}\!\langle\nabla,{{\mathbf{n}}}\rangle`
is the directional gradient in direction :math:`{{\mathbf{n}}}` – see
Figure. Due to the symmetry of the problem the solution for an infinite
planar boundary :math:`\partial V` is given as

.. math:: D({{\mathbf{x}}}_0,\omega) = -2 \partial_{{\mathbf{n}}}S({{\mathbf{x}}}_0,\omega){\;,}\label{eq:D_wfs}

where the pressure in the outside region is the mirrored interior
pressure given by the source model :math:`S({{\mathbf{x}}},\omega)` for
:math:`{{\mathbf{x}}}\in V`. The integral equation resulting from
introducing  into  for a planar boundary :math:`\partial V` is known as
*Rayleigh’s first integral equation*. This solution is identical to the
explicit solution for planar geometries  in :math:`{\mathbb{R}}^3` and
for linear geometries  in :math:`{\mathbb{R}}^2`.

A solution of  for arbitrary boundaries can be found by applying the
*Kirchhoff* or *physical optics approximation* [ColtonKress1983]_, page 53–54.
In acoustics this is also known as *determining the visible
elements* for the high frequency boundary element method [Herrin2003]_.
Here, it is assumed that a bent surface can be approximated
by a set of small planar surfaces for which  holds locally. In general,
this will be the case if the wave length is much smaller than the size
of a planar surface patch and the position of the listener is far away
from the secondary sources, compare the assumptions made before (15) in
[SporsZotter2013]_, which lead to the derivation of the same
window function in a more explicit way. Additionally, only one part of
the surface is active: the area that is illuminated from the incident
field of the source model. With this approximation also non-convex
secondary source distributions can be used with WFS – compare Figure
and appendix in [LaxFeshbach1947]_. This was neglected in most of
the literature so far, which postulates convex secondary source
distributions, e.g. [Spors2008]_.

The outlined approximation can be formulated by introducing a window
function :math:`w({{\mathbf{x}}}_0)` for the selection of the active
secondary sources into  as

.. math::

   P({{\mathbf{x}}},\omega) \approx \oint_{\partial V} \!\!  G({{\mathbf{x}}}|{{\mathbf{x}}}_0,\omega) \,
       \underbrace{-2 w({{\mathbf{x}}}_0) \partial_{{\mathbf{n}}}S({{\mathbf{x}}}_0,\omega)}_{D({{\mathbf{x}}}_0,\omega)} \; {\mathop{\mathrm{d}{A}}}({{\mathbf{x}}}_0) {\;.}\label{eq:P_wfs}

One of the advantages of the applied approximation is that due to its
local character the solution of the driving function  does not depend on
the geometry of the secondary sources. This dependency applies to the
direct solutions presented in Section.
