Problem statement
-----------------

The problem of sound field synthesis can be formulated after
as follows. Assume a volume :math:`V \subset \mathbb{R}^n`
which is free of any sources and sinks, surrounded by a distribution of
monopole sources on its surface :math:`\partial V`. The pressure
:math:`P(\x,\omega)` at a point :math:`\x\in V`
is then given by the *single-layer potential* (compare p. 39 in
[ColtonKress1998]_)

.. math::
    :label: single_layer

    P(\x,\omega) = \oint_{\partial V} D(\x_0,\omega) G(\x-\x_0,\omega) \;
    {\mathop{\mathrm{d}{A}}}(\x_0) \;,

where :math:`G(\x-\x_0,\omega)` denotes the sound propagation of the source at
location :math:`\x_0 \in \partial V`, and :math:`D(\x_0,\omega)` its weight,
usually referred to as *driving function*. The sources on the surface are called
*secondary sources* in sound field synthesis, analogue to the case of acoustical
scattering problems. The single-layer potential can be derived from the
Kirchhoff-Helmholtz integral [Williams1999]_. The challenge in sound field
synthesis is to solve the integral with respect to :math:`D(\x_0,\omega)` for a
desired sound field :math:`P = S` in :math:`V`. It has unique solutions which
[ZotterSpors2013]_ explicitly showed for the spherical case and [Fazi2010]_
(Chap.4.3) for the planar case.

In the following the single-layer potential for different dimensions is
discussed. An approach to formulate the desired sound field :math:`S` is
described and finally it is shown how to derive the driving function
:math:`D`.
