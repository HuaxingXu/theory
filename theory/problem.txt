Problem statement
-----------------

The problem of sound field synthesis can be formulated as
follows [Wierstorf2013]_. Assume a volume :math:`V \subset {\mathbb{R}}^n`
which is free of any sources and sinks, surrounded by a distribution of
monopole sources on its surface :math:`\partial V`. The pressure
:math:`P({{\mathbf{x}}},\omega)` at a point :math:`{{\mathbf{x}}}\in V`
is then given by the *single-layer potential*

.. math:: P({{\mathbf{x}}},\omega) = \oint_{\partial V} D({{\mathbf{x}}}_0,\omega) G({{\mathbf{x}}}-{{\mathbf{x}}}_0,\omega) \; {\mathop{\mathrm{d}{A}}}({{\mathbf{x}}}_0) {\;,}{  \label{eq:single:layer}}

where :math:`G({{\mathbf{x}}}-{{\mathbf{x}}}_0,\omega)` denotes the
sound propagation of the source at location
:math:`{{\mathbf{x}}}_0 \in \partial V`, and
:math:`D({{\mathbf{x}}}_0,\omega)` its weight, usually referred to as
*driving function*. The sources on the surface are called *secondary
sources* in sound field synthesis, analogue to the case of acoustical
scattering problems. The single-layer potential can be derived from the
Kirchhoff-Helmholtz integral [Williams1999]_. The challenge in sound
field synthesis is to solve the integral with respect to
:math:`D({{\mathbf{x}}}_0,\omega)` for a desired sound field
:math:`P = S` in :math:`V`. It has unique solutions which [ZotterSpors2013]_
explicitly showed for the spherical case
and [Fazi2010]_ (Chap.4.3) for the planar case.

In the following the single-layer potential for different dimensions is
discussed. An approach to formulate the desired sound field :math:`S` is
described and finally it is shown how to derive the driving function
:math:`D`.
