Spatial Sound Presentation
--------------------------

The first ever practical attempt of spatial sound reproduction dates
back to 1881, only five years after the invention of the first monaural
transducer. Back then, two parallel telephone channels were used to
transmit recorded music to the homes of the listeners [Moncel1881]_. The
basic idea was the ability to influence the interaural differences
between the two ear signals of the listener. That was achieved by
recording a sound scene with two microphones placed at different
positions and feeding the recorded signals to the two telephone
channels.

Later on the idea advanced to the technique of *binaural presentation*
where the basic principle is to recreate the ear signals at both ears as
they would appear in reality. This can be achieved by placing two
microphones in the ears of the listener for recording and playing the
recorded signals back via headphones afterwards. Binaural presentation
has advanced in the last decades by measuring the acoustical
transmission paths between a source and the ears of a listener, so
called HRTFs. Afterwards these can be used to create any sound scene as
long as the required HRTFs are available. Spatial sound presentation via
loudspeakers started in the 1930s, the time when [Blumlein1958]_ invented the
stereophonic recording and reproduction and [SteinbergandSnow1934]_
discussed the idea of the acoustical curtain.
The original idea of the latter was to create a sound field that
mimics the real sound scene. Their practical implementation with two or
three loudspeakers was not able to achieve this. With such low numbers
of loudspeakers the sound field is only controllable at single points in
space. This corresponds to the classical stereophonic setup consisting
of a fixed listener position between the two loudspeakers at a distance
of around 2 m. The human head has a diameter of around
20 cm and hence only one ear can be placed at the point where
the sound field is as desired. But as Steinberg and Snow discovered for
their acoustic curtain, the spatial perception of the listener is not
disturbed as long as she does not move too far away from a line on which
every point has the same distance to both loudspeakers. By staying on
that line the listener perceives an auditory event in the center of both
loudspeakers, if the same acoustical signal is played through them. If
the amplitude of one of the loudspeakers is changed the auditory event
is moved between the two speakers. The connection of the amplitude
difference between the loudspeakers and the actual position of the
auditory event is empirical and is described by so called panning
laws [Leakey1959]_. If the listener leaves the central line, the position
of the auditory event will always be located at the position of one of
the two loudspeakers. The area in which the spatial perception of the
auditory scene works without considerable impairments is called the
*sweet-spot* of a given loudspeaker setup. It is indicated by the blue
color in Figure. To explain why the spatial perception of the listener
is correct at the sweet-spot although the sound field is not, the theory
of *summing localization* was introduced by Warncke in 1941, for a discussion
see [Blauert1997]_, page 204.

In the last years the stereophonic setup was expanded to 5.0 surround
and even larger setups [Hamasaki2005]_ and the
panning laws were formulated in a more general way dealing with setups
using multiple loudspeakers [Pulkki1997]_. These approaches could not fix
the sweet-spot problem, but added a richer spatial impression because
sound is no longer restricted to come from the front.

           \draw (-2,-1.93)  node {{\footnotesize}sweet-spot};

Before 5.0 surround there were other approaches to enhance the spatial
impression of stereophony. From the 1970s onwards quadrophony and
Ambisonics [Gerzon1973]_ were developed in order to provide a surround
experience with four loudspeakers. The basic idea of Ambisonics is
comparable to nowadays NFC-HOA for a larger number of loudspeakers: to
describe an extended sound field by spherical basis functions that can
be synthesized by any spherical or circular loudspeaker setup. In
practice, the restriction of the limited number of loudspeakers has led
to the usage of only two spherical basis functions. The results are
loudspeaker signals that are comparable to the case of panning in
stereophony with the difference of more active loudspeakers [Frank2013]_.
If more than four loudspeakers and more than two basis functions
are applied the term is changed to HOA to highlight this fact. For the
perceptual side of Ambisonics the sweet-spot problem exists as well. The
explanation of this sweet-spot is only partly covered by the theory of
summing localization, because that theory is not well investigated for
several sound sources coming from all directions. This provoked a high
number of different optimizations of the loudspeaker signals by the
Ambisonics community.

All of the methods described so far are able to provide a convincing
spatial impression at a specific listener position within the
loudspeaker setup. That means none of them can handle an equally good
spatial impression for a bigger audience.

In the late 1980s the old idea of Steinberg and Snow to reproduce a
complete sound field came to new life due to the fact that now
arrangements of more than 100 loudspeakers became possible [Berkhout1988]_.
This high number of loudspeakers is needed: for controlling an
extended sound field up to 20 kHz, loudspeaker spacings under
1 cm are required. Small distances like that are not possible
in practice. Nonetheless, the experience has shown that even with larger
distances reasonable sound field approximations are possible. Some of
them provide equal spatial impression in the whole listening area, as
indicated by the blue color in Figure. Methods trying to achieve this
goal are summarized under the term SFS. This document focusses on the
two SFS techniques WFS and NFC-HOA that are explained in detail in the
next chapter.
